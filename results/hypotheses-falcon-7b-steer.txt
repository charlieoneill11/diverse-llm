Do the chemical abundances of red giant stars in open clusters show variations that can be explained by different production paradigms for clusters, and can the comparison between open clusters and the literature estimates of chemical enrichment provide insights into the chemodynamical models that underlie the predictions of stellar nucleosynthesis?
Can the chemically peculiar and dynamically interesting open cluster Thornbury have its parameters and evolutionary status determined through chemo-dynamical analysis of its open clusters sequences, providing insight into its bimodal metallicity distribution function and biegeoleity?
Did metal-poor thick disk stars in the Milky Way form in-situ within the disk rather than being accreted from dwarf galaxies or satellite systems?
Can the dynamics of tidally shredded debris track the evolution of the Milky Way's halo assembly, and shed light on the system-wide dynamical properties of the halo, by studying the peripheral regions where few or no stars were born in clusters?Could the low amplitude of breathing motions in the Milky Way be explained by the low incidence of gas undergoing breathers in the densest regions of the disk where amplitude dampening is strongest?
