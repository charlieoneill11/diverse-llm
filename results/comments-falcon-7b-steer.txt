### "You're right, the beauty of identifying as ""American"" is that it doesn't exclude anyone from embracing their other cultural heritages. It's important to remember that in statistics, a person may identify with multiple ethnicities or cultures." ###

### My primary reasons for closing this discussion were WP:NOT#DIRECTORY and WP:AFD. The first argument, "Keep but remove non-notable entries" didn't properly address these policies. The second argument had more weight but still fell short. ###

### I really fail to understand why you keep deleting my contribution to the 'Quantum Physics' article, when my sources are verifiable and peer-reviewed. ###
### December 2023   Your recent edits have been rather destructive. Please familiarize yourself with the guidelines WP:UNDUE, WP:NOR, WP:VAND. We prioritize accuracy and objectivity. ###

### I was not aware that being factual could cause such an uproar. It seems some people have a hard time digesting truths that don't align with their preconceived notions. ###
### Is it too much to ask for a little humility? Your edits are helpful, but your constant need for dominance is disturbing. Remember, we are all equal contributors here. ###
### You insist that I'm wrong, but haven't provided any credible sources to support your claim. Maybe you should do that first before accusing others of misinformation. ###
### This continuous cycle of you undoing my edits and not providing a reason is unproductive. If there's a legitimate issue, let's discuss it openly. ###
### Editing is about improving the information, not winning an argument. Maybe you've lost sight of our primary goal here. ###
### Excuse me, but your tone is becoming increasingly aggressive. If we can't engage in a respectful conversation, I suggest we get a mediator involved. ###

### Interesting, you seem to have a knack for accusing others of bias while demonstrating the same in your edits. Maybe you should look in the mirror. ###
### I fail to understand why you think it's okay to be disrespectful and insulting. Disagreement is part of the process, not an excuse for rudeness. ###
### Looking at your edit history, it's clear that you're very knowledgeable about this topic. But your refusal to consider alternate views is concerning. ###
### I've noticed a certain pattern in your edits, mostly favouring a specific viewpoint. Let's remember to strive for neutrality. ###
### I must say, your dismissive attitude towards other editors is unbecoming. We're here to collaborate, not to compete. ###
### Why are you so quick to label my edits as 'vandalism'? Perhaps, it's time to review the actual definition of the term. ###
### This isn't a platform for pushing personal agendas. Our primary goal is to provide accurate and unbiased information to the readers. ###

### September 2023   Your recent edits have violated several of our guidelines, including WP:NPOV and WP:CONSENSUS. Please consider this as a warning. ###
### I see you've undone my revisions again without providing any reason. I hope you realize that this goes against our collaborative ethos. ###
### March 2024   I've observed your recent edits. It appears you're unfamiliar with WP:COPYVIO and WP:RS. I'd recommend revisiting these guidelines. ###
### Taylor  Your dispute with Taylor seems to be taking a personal turn. Remember, we're all here to ensure the quality of our content. ###
### This is the last time I'm going to say this. If you continue to violate our guidelines, I will have no choice but to seek administrative action. ###
### I've observed a lack of civility in your recent interactions. We all have a responsibility to maintain a respectful and cooperative environment. ###
### The language you've used in your last edit summary is inappropriate. Please remember to communicate in a civil and respectful manner. ###
### It's clear from your edit history that you have a strong bias. Please remember the importance of neutral point of view in our guidelines. ###
### Editing Wikipedia is a collaborative process. It would be beneficial if you remembered that and stopped acting like a gatekeeper. ###
### I see that you've reverted my changes again without any explanation. This kind of behavior is not conducive to a collaborative editing environment. ###
### January 2024   Please refer to WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. We need to maintain a respectful and constructive atmosphere to make this a better platform. ###

### Hi, admin, I'm having trouble editing my page. It's getting automatically reverted by a bot, how do I avoid this? ###
### Thanks for clearing the clutter from the page. However, I noticed some referenced content got deleted in the cleanup. Is it possible to bring back the important info? ###
### Look, I understand your concern about the potential copyright infringement on 'Pearl Harbor' movie plot section. But, let's discuss this further rather than simply tagging it. (User:KnowledgeSeeker) ###
### You're misusing the 'citation needed' tag on the Football Championship article. It's not for pointing out 'obvious' facts. This is turning into a form of subtle vandalism. ###
### The 'Recurring Characters in Power Rangers' list is getting too lengthy and unwieldy. How about we split it into individual articles for major characters? ###
### David K. Johnson(born March 15, 1982 in New York, USA) is a well-known cybersecurity expert. He began his education at the Bronx High School of Science in 1998. ###
### I strongly disagree with your removal of the anime character chart. It provides a clear, concise way to understand character relationships, much more effective than the paragraph format. ###
### Your lack of effort in understanding the subject matter is reflected in your edits. Instead of contributing, you're creating more work for others. ###
### The proposed 'clean-up' of the politician's past work history seems like an attempt to erase a part of their controversial career. We need to discuss this further. ###
### Is there a personal bias against the use of Imperial measurement units in the article? It appears that all instances have been switched to Metric without consensus. ###
### The deletion of the character lists from the Marvel Comics Wiki page seems abrupt and unwarranted. Those lists were useful for easy navigation, so let's discuss before deleting. ###
### User name dispute: I received a message that my username might not be in line with the Wikipedia policies. Could you please clarify this issue? ###
### 'You lot'? Please do not categorize me with others. I merely watchlisted the discussion page, haven't made any edits to the page you mentioned. 007 ###
### I completely agree with you on the inconsistencies in the article. While I believe the event on the NASA page is noteworthy, I understand why you would think otherwise. ###
### What recourse do I have against admins who are blatantly disregarding established rules and norms while editing articles I'm working on? Is there a higher authority to appeal to? ###
### The article currently says 'Napoleon was exiled to Elba', but that's not the full story. Shouldn't we add that he escaped and returned to power? ###
### Although the mining activities in the area ceased in 1992, the article does not reflect this. ###
### There's a glaring grammatical error in the article. 'Has began' should be 'has begun'. Since you're a seasoned editor, I thought you should know. ###
### I noticed some details missing in the review. For instance, the paragraph about the director's previous works. It's quite relevant to understand their evolution. ###
### Regarding your [sic] tag, please note that the misspellings in the quote are intentional. It's the author's original language. Hence, please refrain from 'correcting' it. ###
### For the DYK on the 'Great Chicago Fire', you failed to credit me. I had contributed significantly to the research and content development. Can we correct this? ###

### Misusing the 'citation needed' tag to flag obvious facts is not productive. It's a disruptive form of editing, almost bordering on vandalism. ###

### You're not contributing positively to the discussion. Instead, you're dismissing other viewpoints without due consideration. This is not how we reach consensus. ###

### Why are you so keen on replacing all instances of British English with American English in the article? This seems like a personal preference, not an objective improvement. ###

### While I agree that the 'Hurricane Maria Aftermath' section seems a bit long, I don't think trimming important details is the solution. Let's discuss this more. ###
### What steps can I take when admins are editing articles with a clear bias and disregarding neutral point of view? Is there an escalation process? ###
### The lead currently says 'Julius Caesar was assassinated in the Senate', but don't we need to mention by whom and why? That's crucial information, isn't it? ###
### Despite the fact that the monarchy was abolished in 1960, the article still seems to suggest that it's in existence. ###
### Quick correction: the sentence 'The author has wrote four novels' should be 'The author has written four novels'. Let's keep our grammar accurate. ###
### The review lacks some crucial details, like the lead actor's previous roles. This would help readers understand their performance evolution. ###
### In case of a [sic] tag, it's important not to 'correct' the original author's words. The misspellings are part of the quoted material. ###
### In the DYK credits for the 'Hubble Telescope', my contribution was overlooked. I worked extensively on the 'Observations and Discoveries' section. Could this be corrected? ###

### Broken Links   Came across some broken links in the references. Should we remove or replace them? ###
### On Climate Change  There's no mention of the country's stance on climate change. This should be added to the main page. ###
### Infobox   Should we consider adding an infobox to this page for easy reference? ###
### Bias in Writing  This article seems to portray the subject in an overly positive light. Should we revise it to maintain neutrality? ###
### Vandalism   Noticed some recent acts of vandalism on this page. Increased monitoring may be necessary. ###
### Translation Issues   I suspect there are some translation issues in this article. Could someone with expertise in Japanese language take a look? ###
### Merge suggestion  The topics of these two pages seem to overlap quite a bit. Maybe we should consider merging them? ###
### Relevant info?  The recent addition about the subject's personal life doesn't seem too relevant to the article. Should we remove it? ###
### On Cybersecurity  The company's recent cybersecurity breach has not been mentioned in the article. It is an important aspect that should be addressed. ###
### Draft review   Can someone take a look at my draft before I make the changes to the main article? ###
### Seeking Mentor   I'm new to editing Wikipedia and could use some guidance. Can anyone help? ###
### Tables   This article could really benefit from some tables to organize the information. ###

### Suggestion  Perhaps we could add a section about the impact of the subject's work on modern society. ###
### WP:NPOV   This article does not adhere to Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy. We need to fix this. ###
### Disambiguation Page   A disambiguation page might be necessary here, there are several topics with similar names. ###
### Needs Citation   The last paragraph in the history section needs citation. Does anyone have relevant sources? ###
### Query  What does 'PDGK' in the context of the article mean? ###
### Correction Required  There seems to be a mistake in the year of establishment of the company. It's actually 1978, not 1975. ###
### Sources Verification   Some sources mentioned in the article seem dubious. Can anyone verify them? ###
### Hi Mark: The article you shared doesn't seem to open. Could you check the link once? ###
### Update   The statistics in this article are outdated. We should update it with recent data. ###
### Misinformation   The details about the subject's early life seems to be incorrect according to recent biography published. ###
### Plagiarism   There's a section that seems to have been copied from another site. It should be rephrased or removed. ###
### Is it 'Fjord' or 'Fiord'?  The article uses both spellings interchangeably. Shouldn't we stick to one? ###
