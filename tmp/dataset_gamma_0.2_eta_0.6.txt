Does correcting radial velocity lists for radial proper motions provide a way to remove systematic errors introduced during spectroscopic observations andastrotime tomography Pipín Moreno {\copyright}Submitted to Arxiv March 2021
 ### Motivation. Radial velocity surveys allow for precise measurements of stellar parameters and velocities, providing a richer datacubes than spectroscopic surveys and complementing astrometry in determining gravitationalpotential gradients and constraining Galactocentric radial peculiar velocitycomponents. Despite significant systematic errors due to?
