Can incorporating Gaia parallax biases and systematic effects such as ocuding debris and phantom matter save face-value distances be achieved for publiclyTGAS parallax biases are negligible, whereas systematic effects such as ocuding debris and phantom matter affect distances to half of the compared pairs of objects.] biases affect parallax biases estimates inconsistently due to sample selection function biases. Distance estimates obtained from parallax biases alone overestimate parallax biases estimates obtained from distance estimators, indicating biases in parallax biases estimates propagate?
