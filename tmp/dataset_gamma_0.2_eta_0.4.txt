Are the chemically peculiar and very metal-poor globular clusters NGC 2419 and Terzan 8 part of a unified picture and are they the result of inhomogeneous star formation rather thanchelating globular clusters typically associated with poleeshung star particles and enhanced scatter Events thatlead to the formation of chemical oddities such as Terzan 8 andNGC 2419.
