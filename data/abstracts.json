We have\\nimplemented gas infall into a chemical evolution model of the Galaxy disc, and\\nused a Schmidt-Kennicutt law to connect the infall to the star formation. We\\nexplore a number of models, and two different formulations of the infall law.\\nIn one formulation, the infall is non-parametric, and in the other the infall\\nhas an explicitly exponential form. We fit the model parameters to the\\ntime-[Si/Fe] distribution of solar vicinity stars, and the metallicity and\\n[Si/Fe] distribution function of stars with a galactocentric radius between 4-6\\nkpc from APOGEE. Our results point to a fast early gas accretion, with an upper\\nlimit of accretion timescale of around 2 Gyr in the inner disc of the Milky\\nWay. This suggests that at least half the baryons were in place within 2-3 Gyr\\nof the Big Bang, and that half the stars of the inner disc formed within the\\nfirst 5 Gyr, during the thick disc formation phase. This implies that the\\nstellar mass of the inner disc is dominated by the thick disc, supporting our\\nprevious work, and that the gas accretion onto the inner disc was rapid and\\nearly."

The two aims of this paper are to revise the results for the sample\\nfrom paper I using Gaia EDR3 data and to expand the sample of analyzed stellar\\ngroups to 26, from Villafranca O-001 to Villafranca O-026.\\n  METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O stars and an\\nupdated version of the method in paper 0 of this series, combining Gaia EDR3\\nG+GBP+GRP photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign\\nmemberships and measure distances. We present 99 spectra from GOSSS and 32 from\\nLiLiMaRlin for stars in the analyzed groups or in their foreground.\\n  RESULTS. We derive distances to the 26 stellar groups with unprecedented\\nprecision and accuracy, with total uncertainties <1% within 1 kpc and of ~3%\\naround 3 kpc, values that are almost 4x better than for Gaia DR2. We provide\\nhomogeneous spectral types for 110 stars and correct a number of errors in the\\nliterature, especially for objects in the Orion nebula cluster. For each of the\\ngroups we discuss its membership and present possible runaway/walkaway stars.\\nAt least two groups, Villafranca O-O12 S and Villafranca O-014 NW, are orphan\\nclusters in which the most massive stars have been ejected by dynamical\\ninteractions, leaving objects with a capped mass function.

We measured 31 species of 29 elements in two stars\\nfrom high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster is\\nmoderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately\\n$\\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex level. While from the small sample alone it is\\ndifficult to assert any abundance correlations, the light elements Na,O,Mg, and\\nAl differ significantly between the two stars in contrast to the majority of\\nother elements with smaller scatter; this argues in favour of multiple\\ngenerations of stars coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity,\\nNGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances that are consistent with $r$-process\\nnucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites. In particular the\\nEu overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event,\\nsuch as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be\\nresponsible for the stellar enhancement or even the enrichment of the cluster\\nwith the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble\\nthe moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the halo and have\\nbeen detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well. Therefore, combining all kinematical,\\nage, and chemical evidence we conclude that NGC 1261 is a chemically intriguing\\nGC that was born in Gaia-Enceladus and has been subsequently accreted into the\\nMW halo.

Gaia EDR3 has produced parallaxes for 1.468x10^9 sources but there\\nare calibration issues that require corrections to the published values and\\nuncertainties. AIMS. We want to characterize the behavior of the uncertainties\\nof the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. We also aim to provide a procedure for the\\ncalculation of distances to stars and stellar clusters. METHODS. We reanalyze\\nsome of the data in the calibration papers for QSO and LMC parallaxes and\\ncombine those results with measurements for six bright GCs. We calculate the\\nangular covariance of EDR3 parallaxes at small separations based on the LMC\\nresults and combine it with the results for larger angles using QSOs to obtain\\nan analytical formula for the angular covariance over the whole sky. The\\nresults for the six GCs are used to validate the parallax bias correction as a\\nfunction of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude and to determine the\\nconstant used to convert internal uncertainties to external ones. RESULTS. The\\nangular covariance at zero separation is 106.2 muas^2, yielding a minimum\\nuncertainty for EDR3 parallaxes of 10.3 muas for individual stars. That value\\ncan be only slightly reduced for GCs after considering the behavior of the\\nangular covariance of the parallaxes for small separations. The Lindegren et\\nal. parallax bias correction works quite well, except for the brighter\\nmagnitudes, suggesting improvements may be possible there. The value of k is\\n1.1-1.7 and depends on G. Stars with moderately large values of RUWE can still\\nprovide useful parallaxes albeit with larger values of k. We give accurate and\\nprecise Gaia EDR3 distances to the six GCs and for the specific case of 47 Tuc\\nwe are able to beat the angular covariance limit and derive a high-precision\\ndistance of 4.53+-0.06 kpc.

Extratidal stars are stellar bodies that end up outside the tidal\\nradius of a cluster as a result of internal processes or external forces acting\\nupon it. The presence and spatial distribution of these stars can give us\\ninsights into the past evolution of a cluster inside our Galaxy. Aims. Previous\\nworks suggest that globular clusters, when explored in detail, show evidence of\\nextratidal stars. We aim to search for possible extratidal stars in the\\nGalactic globular clusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266 using the\\nphotometry and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 database (Gaia\\nCollaboration et al. 2018). Results. Finally, 120, 126, and 107 extratidal\\ncandidate stars were found lying outside the tidal radius of the globular\\nclusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. 70%, 25.4%, and 72.9%\\nof the extratidal stars found are located outside the Jacobi radius of NGC\\n6397, NGC 2808, and NGC 6266, respectively. The spatial distribution of the\\nextratidal stars belonging to NGC 6397 appears S-like, extending along the\\ncurved leading and trailing arms. NGC 2808 has an overdensity of stars in the\\ntrailing part of the cluster and NGC 6266 seems to have overdensities of\\nextratidal stars in its eastern and northern sides. Conclusions. Proper motions\\nand color-magnitude diagrams can be used to identify extratidal candidate stars\\naround GCs. Nonetheless, depending on how different the kinematics and stellar\\npopulations of a cluster are compared to the Milky Way field, the fraction of\\ncontamination can be larger. All three clusters are found to have extratidal\\nstars outside their tidal radii. For NGC 6397 and NGC 2808, these stars may be\\nthe result of a combined effect of the disc shocks and tidal disruptions.

To identify clusters with a common origin we analysed their\\ndynamical properties, particularly in the space of integrals of motion.\\n$Results$.

Of the remaining clusters, 16% are tentatively\\nassociated to a group with high binding energy, while the rest are all on\\nloosely bound orbits and likely have a more heterogeneous origin. The resulting\\nage-metallicity relations are remarkably tight and differ in their detailed\\nproperties depending on the progenitor, providing further confidence on the\\nassociations made. $Conclusions$.

The\\nresulting mean Fe abundance is $-0.62\\pm$0.03(stat.)$\\pm$0.10(sys.) dex, which\\nis more metal-poor than indicated by previous spectroscopy from the literature,\\nbut it is fully in line with values from isochrone fitting. We find that Gaia 1\\nis moderately enhanced in the $\\alpha$-elements, which allowed us to\\nconsolidate its membership with the thick disk via chemical tagging. The\\ncluster's Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements are similar to those found\\nacross the metal-rich disks, where the latter indicate some level of\\n$s$-process activity. No significant spread in iron nor in other heavy elements\\nwas detected, whereas we find evidence of light-element variations in Na, Mg,\\nand Al.

Direct measurement of\\nthree-dimensional velocities, based on accurate proper motions and\\nline-of-sight velocities, has revealed that the majority of halo stars in the\\ninner-halo region move on eccentric orbits. However, our understanding of the\\nmotions of distant, in-situ halo-star samples is still limited, due to the lack\\nof accurate proper motions for these stars. Here we explore a model-independent\\nanalysis of the line-of-sight velocities and spatial distribution of a recent\\nsample of 1865 carefully selected halo blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars\\nwithin 30 kpc of the Galactic center. We find that the mean rotational velocity\\nof the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.0) BHB stars significantly lags behind that\\nof the relatively more metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -2.0) BHB stars. We also find that\\nthe relatively more metal-rich BHB stars are dominated by stars with eccentric\\norbits, as previously observed for other stellar samples in the inner-halo\\nregion. By contrast, the very metal-poor BHB stars are dominated by stars on\\nrounder, lower-eccentricity orbits. Our results indicate that the motion of the\\nprogenitor systems of the Milky Way that contributed to the stellar populations\\nfound within 30 kpc correlates directly with their metal abundance, which may\\nbe related to their physical properties such as gas fractions.

The X-ray emission of Sgr A*, however, is known to flare\\nroughly daily by factors of a few to ten times over quiescent emission levels,\\nwith rarer flares extending to factors of greater than 100 times quiescence.\\nHere were report an observation performed on 2012 February 9 wherein we\\ndetected what is the highest peak flux and fluence flare ever observed from Sgr\\nA*. The flare, which lasted for 5.6 ks and had a decidedly asymmetric profile\\nwith a faster decline than rise, achieved a mean absorbed 2-8 keV flux of\\n(8.5+/-0.9)X10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The peak flux was 2.5 times higher,\\nand the total 2-10 keV emission of the event was approximately 10^{39} erg.\\nOnly one other flare of comparable magnitude, but shorter duration, has been\\nobserved in Sgr A* by XMM-Newton in 2002 October. We perform spectral fits of\\nthis Chandra observed flare, and compare our results to the two brightest\\nflares ever observed with XMM-Newton. We find good agreement among the fitted\\nspectral slopes (Gamma~2) and X-ray absorbing columns (N_H~15X10^{22} cm^{-2})\\nfor all three of these events, resolving prior differences (which are most\\nlikely due to the combined effects of pileup and spectral modeling) among\\nChandra and XMM-Newton observations of Sgr A* flares. We also discuss fits to\\nthe quiescent spectra of Sgr A*."

Wide-field UBVI photometry combined with infrared information allows\\nus to reconstruct the distribution in reddening and distance of young stars in\\nthe field using the Color-Color and Color-Magnitude diagrams.\\n  The analysis of our data, combined too with extensive spectroscopy taken from\\nliterature shows that the real entity of Trumpler 27 as an open cluster is far\\nfrom being firmly stated. In fact, instead of finding a relatively compact\\ngroup of stars confined to a small distance range, we found that stars\\nassociated to Trumpler 27 are, indeed, a superposition of early type stars seen\\nalong the line of sight extending over several kiloparsecs beyond even the\\ncenter of the galaxy. We demonstrate that at each distance range it becomes\\npossible to generate a color-magnitude diagram resembling that of an open\\ncluster. This way, our analysis indicates that what was considered an open\\ncluster characterized by a significant age spread is a stellar continuum that\\nreaches its maximum number of stars at approximately 3.5 kpc from the Sun, the\\ndistance of the Scutum-Crux arm approximately. At the same time, and after\\nanalyzing the way early type stars distribute with distance, we found some of\\nthese stellar groups may be linked, within the distance errors, with other\\ninner spiral arms of our galaxy, including the Near 3 kpc arm at approximately\\n5 kpc from the Sun. However, very young stars by themselves do not seem to\\ntrace strongly the inner spiral arms since they are distributed evenly across\\nseveral kiloparsecs toward the center of the Galaxy."

Such a disc is unstable to fragmentation and\\nmay lead to the formation of young massive stars in the central parsec of the\\nGalaxy. Here we perform high-accuracy direct summation N-body simulations of a\\nring of massive stars (with initial semi-major axes 0.1 < a/pc < 0.4 and\\neccentricities 0.2 < e < 0.4), subject to the potential of the SMBH, a stellar\\ncusp, and the parent gas disc, to study how the orbital elements of the ring\\nevolve in time. The initial conditions for the stellar ring are drawn from the\\nresults of previous simulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the\\nSMBH potential. While semi-major axes do not evolve significantly, the\\ndistribution of eccentricities spreads out very fast (~1 Myr) as a consequence\\nof cusp precession. In particular, stellar orbits with initial eccentricity\\ne>0.3 (e<0.3) tend to become even more (less) eccentric, resulting in a bimodal\\neccentricity distribution. The distribution is qualitatively consistent with\\nthat of the massive stars observed in the Galactic Centre's clockwise disc."

We\\nemploy the cylindrically symmetric form of Jeans equations and focus on the\\nmorphology of the resulting acceleration maps, rather than the normalization of\\nthe total mass as done in previous, mostly local, studies. Jeans equations are\\nfirst applied to a mock catalog based on a cosmologically derived N-body + SPH\\nsimulation, and the known acceleration (gradient of gravitational potential) is\\nsuccessfully recovered.

We apply Jeans equations to this catalog and produce\\ntwo-dimensional maps of stellar acceleration. These maps reveal that in a\\nNewtonian framework, the implied gravitational potential cannot be explained by\\nvisible matter alone. The acceleration experienced by stars at galactocentric\\ndistances of ~20 kpc is three times larger than what can be explained by purely\\nvisible matter. The application of an analytic method for estimating the dark\\nmatter halo axis ratio to SDSS data implies an oblate halo with q_DM = 0.47 +/-\\n0.14 within the same distance range. These techniques can be used to map the\\ndark matter halo to much larger distances from the Galactic center using\\nupcoming deep optical surveys, such as LSST."

        "text": "### Instruction: Generate a scientific hypothesis about astronomy in the style of an Arxiv paper.\n ### Hypothesis: The cold dark matter halo mass function is much steeper than the galaxy\\nstellar mass function on galactic and subgalactic scales. This difference is\\nusually reconciled by assuming that the galaxy formation efficiency drops\\nsharply with decreasing halo mass, so that virtually no dwarf galaxies form in\\nhalos less massive than ~ 10^10 M_sun. In turn, this implies that, at any given\\nradius, the dark mass enclosed by a galaxy must exceed a certain minimum. We\\nuse rotation curves of dwarf galaxies compiled from the literature to explore\\nwhether their enclosed mass is consistent with these constraints. We find that\\nalmost one half of the dwarfs in our sample with stellar mass between 10^6-10^7\\nM_sun are at odds with this restriction: either they live in halos with masses\\nsubstantially below 10^10 M_sun or there is a mechanism capable of reducing the\\ndark mass enclosed by some of the faintest dwarfs. Neither possibility is\\neasily accommodated within the standard LCDM scenario. Extending galaxy\\nformation to halos well below 10^10 M_sun would lead to large numbers of dwarf\\ngalaxies in excess of current estimates; at the same time, the extremely low\\nstellar mass of the systems involved makes it unlikely that baryonic effects\\ncan reduce their dark matter content. Resolving this challenge seems to require\\nnew insights into dwarf galaxy formation, or perhaps a radical revision of the\\nprevailing paradigm."
